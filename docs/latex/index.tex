Remote Vehicle Interface (R\+VI) provides an architecture which, through its specified components, enables connected vehicles and other devices to form a secured distributed, sparsely connected peer-\/to-\/peer network. In particular, local services can be registered to enable remote invocation only when the peer presents appropriate credentials. In general, R\+VI provides an intermediary between less trusted remote sources and more trusted internal sources, while limiting direct communication channels.

{\ttfamily rvi\+\_\+lib} provides a client implementation in C. This is supplemental to \href{https://github.com/GENIVI/rvi_core}{\tt R\+VI Core}, which adds a variety of capabilities including listening for incoming connections.

\section*{Build Requirements}

{\ttfamily rvi\+\_\+lib} depends on the following libraries\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \href{https://www-s.acm.illinois.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/index.html}{\tt C Standard Library}
\item \href{https://www.openssl.org/}{\tt Open\+S\+SL}
\item \href{http://www.digip.org/jansson/}{\tt Jansson}
\item \href{https://github.com/benmcollins/libjwt}{\tt Lib\+J\+WT} †
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

† Please note that this project contains modified code for libjwt to support public-\/private key cryptography for J\+S\+ON Web Tokens. As such, no further downloads are required for lib\+J\+WT at the present time. However, this is subject to change when the upstream project supports tokens encoded using R\+S256.

{\ttfamily rvi\+\_\+lib} does not currently depend on the following but may add any or all to support interoperability with \href{https://github.com/GENIVI/rvi_core}{\tt R\+VI Core} nodes\+:
